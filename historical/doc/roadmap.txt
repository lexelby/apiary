= 0.7 =

- Dumb HTTP support - playback of literal http requests to a socket. 
- Fix the MySQL parser so that it does not silently ignore parse errors.
- Create abstractions for the queue messages that uses a simple encoding scheme (maybe utf-8 simplejson encoding?).
- Open source announcement.


= Some upcoming release =

- A consistent log format for all message types (at least the same 3rd party, tested, parsing library).
- Redesign everything to avoid Python threads:
  The QueenBee will become a separate process that communicates explicitly by producing to message queues.
  The BeeKeeper will launch subprocesses then listen to message queues in a blocking manner.
  The Workers respond to message queue events.


= Longer Term =

- Write a high performance worker using something like twisted or greenlet.
  This needs the message queue and target protocol clients to work with the high performance model.
